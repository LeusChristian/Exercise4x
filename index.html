<h1>Buggati Bolide</h1>
<div>
<img Src="https://robbreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Bugatti_Bolide2.jpg?w=1000"class="left" width="600" height="500">
<p><font size="4"> Bolide is set to keep most of the outrageous aero-sculpted design of the concept, notably a skeletal front end that has been built around a carbon-fiber version of Bugatti's trademark horseshoe-shaped radiator grille. It isn't just a stripped-back Chiron; it's built around a carbon-fiber monocoque that is clearly lower and smaller than that of its roadgoing sister. Bugatti hasn't released any detail views of the Bolide's interior yet.
The rear view is dominated by both a substantial dual-element wing and a quartet of exhaust pipes, these between what look to be Lotus Evija–style Venturi tunnels and above a huge diffuser. There is also an intake periscope mounted to the cockpit roof together with an extended in-line wing element that runs over the engine cover. Bugatti hasn’t released any claimed aerodynamic downforce figures, but the car seems certain to produce substantial negative lift.
Power comes from Bugatti’s long-serving quad-turbocharged W-16 engine, a developed version of the powerplant that has been used in all the company’s modern era products since the Veyron launched in 2005. In the original "experimental vehicle" concept, this ran on 110-octane race fuel and was claimed to be capable of producing up to 1825 horsepower. For the production Bolide, the company has opted to keep the engine tune compatible with commercially available premium gasoline, restricting output to a more modest 1578 horsepower, the same as in the Chiron Super Sport and Centodieci. This is accompanied by 1180 pound-feet of torque, available from just 2250 rpm.

<h1>Lamborghini Aventador SVJ</h1>

<p><font size="4"> Lamborghini still hasn't shared much about the "most powerful V-12 from Lamborghini to date"—only that it'll produce more than 819 horsepower thanks to a ram-air effect at high speeds. A six-speed sequential gearbox turns the rear wheels, and big Brembo brakes are on hand to slow everything down. Currently, the most powerful iteration of the Lamborghini's V-12 is in the Aventador SVJ, which produces 759 horsepower.</font></p>
